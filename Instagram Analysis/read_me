# 📊 Instagram Analysis Project

This project dives into analyzing Instagram video performance using a dataset of over 13,000 videos. The aim is to identify factors influencing reach, engagement, and visibility — ultimately guiding better content strategy decisions for creators and marketers.

## 📁 Project Structure


## 💡 Objective

To explore how variables like hashtags, duration, tags, and timing affect video performance (views, comments, shares) using SQL and Power BI.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL (MySQL)**: For data wrangling and deep querying
- **Power BI**: For dashboard creation and data visualization
- **Excel**: For summary reporting and insight tracking
- **Python (optional)**: For any initial preprocessing (if used)

---

## ❓ Key Questions Answered

- Which videos received the highest views and why?
- Does video duration correlate with performance?
- Do more hashtags or tags improve visibility?
- What's the best time to publish content?
- What insights can we gather from highly commented videos?

---

## 🧠 Insights Highlights

- **Tags vs. Performance**: Videos with 8–12 tags performed better on average.
- **Optimal Video Length**: Videos between 25–40 seconds gained more traction.
- **Engagement Timing**: Early morning (8 AM–10 AM) had higher interaction rates.
- **View vs. Comments Correlation**: A strong positive trend was observed.
